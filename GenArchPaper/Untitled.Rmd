`glmnet` solves the following problem <span class="math">\[
\min_{\beta_0,\beta} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i l(y_i,\beta_0+\beta^T x_i) + \lambda\left[(1-\alpha)||\beta||_2^2/2 + \alpha ||\beta||_1\right],
\]</span> over a grid of values of <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> covering the entire range. 

The elastic-net penalty is controlled by $\alpha$, and bridges the gap between lasso ($\alpha=1$, the default) and ridge ($\alpha=0$). The tuning parameter $\lambda$ controls the overall strength of the penalty.

$\alpha=0, 0.05, 0.1, ..., 0.90, 0.95, 1$
